# LDAP-wrapper for Microsoft Entra ID users/groups [![GitHub release (latest by date)](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/ahaenggli/AzureAD-LDAP-wrapper?style=social)](https://github.com/ahaenggli/AzureAD-LDAP-wrapper) <a href="https://www.buymeacoffee.com/ahaenggli" target="_blank"><img src="https://cdn.buymeacoffee.com/buttons/default-orange.png" alt="Buy Me A Coffee" width="90px"></a>

LDAP-wrapper is a Node.js LDAP server built on top of ([ldapjs](https://github.com/ldapjs/node-ldapjs)) that allows users and groups from `Microsoft Entra ID` (formerly `Azure Active Directory`) to be accessed through the LDAP protocol. User authentication is performed using Microsoft Graph API on every login attempt. This allows your other applications to connect to the LDAP server and thus allows your end users to authenticate with a work or school account.

This it a possible workaround for older applications that lack Microsoft Entra ID support or for scenarios where managing a local AD controller is undesirable.

    end

```

The LDAP-wrapper starts an LDAP server and fetches users and groups from the Microsoft Graph API. These are cached and merged locally.

When an LDAP client attempts to bind with user credentials, the LDAP-wrapper checks these credentials by communicating with the Microsoft Graph API. If the credentials are valid, the Microsoft Graph API sends a success response to the LDAP-wrapper, which then sends a successful bind message to the user's LDAP client. Additionally, the LDAP-wrapper saves the user's password hash in the sambaNTPassword attribute and sets the sambaPwdLastSet attribute to "now". This allows the user to access samba shares, such as those on a NAS, from Windows PCs.

The LDAP-wrapper periodically fetches user and group information from the Microsoft Graph API every 30 minutes, merging and caching the results locally. This process preserves attributes like uid, gid, sambaNTPassword, and sambaPwdLastSet.

## Getting Started

### Requirements

To use the LDAP-wrapper, you will need:

* A Microsoft Entra tenant with at least one registered user.
* A Microsoft Entra application registered in your tenant, with the following permissions:
  * For type `Application` grant `User.Read.All` and `Group.Read.All`.
  * For type `Delegated` grant `User.Read`.

  You can follow the instructions in the [installation guide](https://ahaenggli.github.io/AzureAD-LDAP-wrapper/installation/create-azuread-application) to set up your application.

To run the LDAP-wrapper, you'll need to have your Tenant ID, Application ID, and Application Secret available. These values are required to authenticate and authorize the application to access your resources. You can find these values in the Microsoft Entra ID portal.

Once you have created your Microsoft Entra application, you can run the LDAP-wrapper on your local machine, on a server or even a Synology NAS. Depending on your setup you will either need:

* Node.js version 17 or higher, which can be downloaded from the official [Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

or

* Docker, which can be downloaded from the official [Docker website](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop).

Note that some features of the wrapper may require additional configuration or dependencies, such as a  NAS for network storage access.

### Run the LDAP-wrapper

There are multiple ways to run the LDAP-wrapper. For more information, please consult the [documentation](https://ahaenggli.github.io/AzureAD-LDAP-wrapper/installation/run-ldap-wrapper/) to get started.

One way to run the LDAP-wrapper is, to start a Docker container on a Synolog NAS like this:

1. Install Docker from the Synology Package Center.
![package center](https://ahaenggli.github.io/AzureAD-LDAP-wrapper/installation/syno/syno_install_docker.png)

2. In Docker, go to "Registry" to download the latest container image.
![download latest image](https://ahaenggli.github.io/AzureAD-LDAP-wrapper/installation/syno/syno_docker_download.png)

3. In Docker, go to "Image" to launch a new container. Use "bridge" as your network.
![launch image](https://ahaenggli.github.io/AzureAD-LDAP-wrapper/installation/syno/syno_docker_launch.png)
Use "bridge" as your network.

4. Give your container a name and enable auto-restart.
![grafik](https://ahaenggli.github.io/AzureAD-LDAP-wrapper/installation/syno/syno_docker_name.png)

5. Configure the environment variables in "Advanced Settings". Be sure to double check your Microsoft Entra values and define at least one binduser. The binduser (superuser like root) does not need to exist in your tenant. Replace example.com with your domain. Here is an example of a minimum required configuration:

    ```bash
    TZ: "Europe/Zurich" # optional
    AZURE_TENANTID: "0def2345-ff01-56789-1234-ab9d6dda1e1e"
    AZURE_APP_ID: "abc12345-ab01-0000-1111-a1e1eab9d6dd"
    AZURE_APP_SECRET: "iamasecret~yep-reallyreallysecret"
    LDAP_DOMAIN: "example.com"
    LDAP_BASEDN: "dc=example,dc=com"
    LDAP_BINDUSER: "ldapsearch|*secretldapsearch123*||root|*secretroot*"
    LDAP_DEBUG: "false" # set this to true for more logs
    GRAPH_IGNORE_MFA_ERRORS: "false" # set this to true to bypass MFA
    DSM7: "true" # set this to false if you are running DSM 6 or lower
    ```

    ![env vars](https://ahaenggli.github.io/AzureAD-LDAP-wrapper/installation/syno/syno_docker_env.png)
    A full list of all environment variables can be found [here](https://ahaenggli.github.io/AzureAD-LDAP-wrapper/configuration/settings/).

6. Set local Port 389 to the Container Port 13389. If you receive the error Local port 389 conflicts with other ports used by other services, make sure that Synology Directory Service and Synology LDAP Server are not installed - they also use this port.
![syno port](https://ahaenggli.github.io/AzureAD-LDAP-wrapper/installation/syno/syno_docker_port.png)

7. Add a local folder, such as docker/ldap, to the mount path /app/.cache in the volume settings. If you skip this step, your data will not be stored permanently.
![syno folder](https://ahaenggli.github.io/AzureAD-LDAP-wrapper/installation/syno/syno_docker_folder.png)

8. Click "Done" to start the container.

### Usage

To enable end users to log in to Synology NAS with their work or school account, you need to connect the NAS to the LDAP-wrapper. Here are the steps:

1. Go to Control Panel > Domain/LDAP and click "Join".
![ldap join](https://ahaenggli.github.io/AzureAD-LDAP-wrapper/installation/use/syno_ldap_join.png)

2. Enter the IP address (e.g., 127.0.0.1) of your NAS as the server address.
![server address](https://ahaenggli.github.io/AzureAD-LDAP-wrapper/installation/use/syno_ldap_serveraddress.png)

3. Enter the credentials of your previously defined superuser (environment variable `LDAP_BINDUSER`) as Bind DN. Should your user not be found, try writing "uid=root" or the full name "uid=root,cn=users,dc=domain,dc=tld" instead of just "root". Select your domain in Base DN.
![enter ldap infos](https://ahaenggli.github.io/AzureAD-LDAP-wrapper/installation/use/syno_ldap_infos.png)

4. If you see a warning about a local group having the same name as a synchronized group, you can ignore it and skip the warning in "Details".
![skip warning](https://ahaenggli.github.io/AzureAD-LDAP-wrapper/installation/use/syno_ldap_skipwarning.png)

5. Your NAS should now be connected successfully to the LDAP-wrapper.
![nas connected](https://ahaenggli.github.io/AzureAD-LDAP-wrapper/installation/use/syno_ldap_connected.png)

6. Check the "LDAP User" and "LDAP Group" tabs to ensure that all entries are fully synced. Assign the desired permissions to your synchronized users and groups. You can now log in with your Microsoft Entra account (work or school account).
![check users](https://ahaenggli.github.io/AzureAD-LDAP-wrapper/installation/use/syno_ldap_check.png)

7. Note that before accessing shared folders or files via network or Samba, each user must log in to DSM web GUI or another tool directly connected to the LDAP server. This step is also required after a password change, as the password hash for Samba is only set after a successful login.

### Settings

To configure the LDAP-wrapper, you can use environment variables as it is intended to be used with Docker. A complete list of available variables can be found in the [configuration settings page](https://ahaenggli.github.io/AzureAD-LDAP-wrapper/configuration/settings) of the documentation.
